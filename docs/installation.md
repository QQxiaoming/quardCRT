> Note: Because the pre-built binary packages we currently release are not officially signed by Apple, when you open the program for the first time, you maybe receive a warning message that the program is from an unidentified developer. If you trust our program, you may need to open terminal and run `xattr -cr /Applications/quardCRT.app` to remove the quarantine attribute. But if you don't trust our program, you shouldn't run it. You can choose to source compile the program by yourself.
